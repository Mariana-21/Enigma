# Enigma


It was definitely a hard project that I wasn't sure how to 
even start but I got through it, I just wish I had realized some 
Things sooner, my command line interface works but not how it was supposed 
to I think, everything else I think is just how it's 
Supposed to be and I'm happy with it, maybe my numeric 
Evaluation would be a 2.8?? 
I feel I will be able to talk about everything with ease 
And explain all of. my logic
